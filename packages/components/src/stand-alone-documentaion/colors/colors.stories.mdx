# Colors

## Color

You can add a theme.colors object to provide colors for your project. By default these colors can be referenced by the color, borderColor, backgroundColor, etc.. props.
You can also add .alpha:{number} to add levels of opacity to a colour. The number can also be added in the theme file.
Ex: red.300:alpha.30, You can read more about this in opacity section.

We recommend adding a palette that ranges from 50 to 900. Tools like Smart Swatch, Palx are available to generate these palettes.
