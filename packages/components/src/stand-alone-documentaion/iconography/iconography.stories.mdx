# Iconography
Icons in the design system are inline SVG. This provides the most flexibility for styling and prevents icons from loading slowly.

## SVG icons

<AllIcons />

`title`

Title allows you to insert invisible text for assistive software like screen readers. It's added as a title to the svg, has no effect on layout and is translatable by Google's translation service.

If the icon is purely decorative, it does not need to have a title.

`color`

You can give the icon a specific fill color:

`size`

Use the size prop to change the size of an icon. Size can be set by using space tokens, type tokens or a hardcoded size value.
