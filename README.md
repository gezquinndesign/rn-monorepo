# React Native Web Monorepo

Originally forked from [react-native-web-monorepo](https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo). Adapted to make use of a design system that functions as a component library - [rn-uilibrary](https://github.com/gezquinndesign/rn-uilibrary).

This repo and the UI Library are designed to be used together to develop a React Native Web project that works on mobile as well as web.
