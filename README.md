Originally forked from https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo. Adapted to make use of a design system that functions as a component library - https://github.com/gezquinndesign/rn-uilibrary.

This repo and the UI Library are designed to be used together to develop a React Native Web project that works on mobile as well as web.
